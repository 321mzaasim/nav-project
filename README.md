## Motivation

Imagine going to a mall and getting lost in the maze of shops. If an augmented reality app could guide users to their destination using the shortest path, it could save users from a lot of hassle and save time.

This app can also be used when exploring unknown places or trekking so that a path can be traced back to the source.



### Applications


#### Malls & Airports
At the entrance, the user will be shown a list of all the shops. Once a destination is selected, a stored AR path is shown.
This service can be made available to a selected number of shops who are paid members.
A subscription model can be implemented for businesses if they wish to stay on the app.

#### Promoted Businesses
Businesses who would like to be promoted can have their places suggested when the app is being used for navigation. This will need to be as unintrusive as possible.

#### Integration with Maps
Once the destination is close enough, Google Maps does not provide the best user experience. In that case an indoor AR application seems more suited to the cause.

  <i>Placing markers ➡ Saving markers ➡  Object guiding user</i>
</p>

## Process

- Open the application
- Enter your destination
- Search for nearby Nav image displayed on the screen 
- Follow the Objects
- You will reach your destination


## Status of the Project

#### What Works
- Detection of real world planes using ARCore
- Placement of markers that will be used to mark the path to be used
- Storing of paths to be used at a later time
- Guiding the user 

####  Future Work

Once multiple paths are stored, they can be integrated into a search like interface so that the user can choose which destination is to be reached.

Other user interface and user experience improvements can be implemented to make the app easier and more pleasing to use.
